DESCRIPTION:

📂 Task 1 – Hangman Game
🎮 Hangman Game – Python Project
📌 About the Task

The Hangman Game is a classic word guessing game developed in Python. The objective of the game is to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. It demonstrates the use of loops, conditionals, string manipulation, and basic Python logic. This task helped me strengthen my fundamentals in Python and provided me with experience in creating an interactive text-based application.
